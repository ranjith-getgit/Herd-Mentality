# Herd-Mentality
A google colaboratory project on identifying herd behaviour among investors in the UK stock market during the black swan (COVID) of 2019. The variables include cross-sectional absolute deviation (CSAD) of all constituents of the FTSE 100 as the response variable and average market returns of FTSE 100 (EWI) as the predictor variable. The project is divided into 3 workbooks for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis and inferential statistics.
